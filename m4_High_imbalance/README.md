The Jupyter Notebook uses `curlyBrace.py`, which was originally created by [Dr. Gao, Siyu](https://github.com/iruletheworld/matplotlib-curly-brace). The original script can be found at: [Curly brace for matplotlib â€” curlyBrace 1.0.1 documentation](https://matplotlib-curly-brace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
